# Tensor-Flow 	
Goal: to set up tensor in windows system first
# how to activate a new environment in anaconda python
## create an environment called “abc”
>conda create –n abc python=3 anaconda

## set path before activate it
>set PATH=D:\anaconda2\envs\abc\Scripts;D:\anaconda2\envs\abc;%PATH%

## activate the environment and get the prompt environment
>Activate cc35
# donwload tensor on the basis of the combination of operation system and python version 
## download tensorflow-cpu in the new environment
>python -m pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/windows/cpu/tensorflow-1.1.0-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl

# with tensorflow, conduct ML & Deep Learning
