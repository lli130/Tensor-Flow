## Tensor-Flow 	
### Objective  
To set up tensor in windows system first, and conduct analytics based on tensorflow
### Procedures
1. how to activate a new environment in anaconda python  
- create an environment called “cc35”
>conda create –n cc35 python=3 anaconda

2. set path before activate it
>set PATH=D:\anaconda2\envs\abc\Scripts;D:\anaconda2\envs\abc;%PATH%

3. activate the environment and get the prompt environment
>Activate cc35 

4. donwload tensor on the basis of the combination of operation system and python version  
- download tensorflow-cpu in the new environment
>python -m pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/windows/cpu/tensorflow-1.1.0-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl

### with tensorflow, conduct ML & Deep Learning
